## We will create 2 functions. First function will create an object to store a matrix.
## The second function will cache its inverse.

## The first function is called makeCacheMatrix. This function will create a matrix
## which is a list containing a function to:
   ## 1/-set the value of the matrix
   ## 2/-get the value of the matrix
   ## 3/-set the value of the inverse
   ## 4/-get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
